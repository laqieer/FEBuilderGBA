# Native Android (Avalonia.Android) — Feasibility Assessment

> The head remains intentionally **not** part of `FEBuilderGBA.sln` (see
> [§7 Build status in this environment](#7-build-status-in-this-environment)).

This assessment is evidence-backed: every claim cites a `file:line` in the
actual codebase as it stood when the doc was written.

## 1. Which layers are Android-capable

FEBuilderGBA is split into layers with very different platform coupling:

| Project | TFM | Android-capable? | Evidence |
|---------|-----|------------------|----------|
| `FEBuilderGBA.Core` | `net9.0` | **Yes** | `FEBuilderGBA.Core/FEBuilderGBA.Core.csproj:3` targets plain `net9.0`; no WinForms / `System.Drawing`. ROM engine, undo, LZ77, Huffman/text codec, etc. are portable. Image/font coupling is behind the `IImageService` / `IFontRasterizer` abstraction seams. |
| `FEBuilderGBA.SkiaSharp` | `net9.0` | **Yes (with a native-version pin — see §3)** | `FEBuilderGBA.SkiaSharp/FEBuilderGBA.SkiaSharp.csproj:13` |
| `FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia` | `net9.0`, opt-in `net9.0-android` (#1121) | **Yes — conditionally multi-targeted** | `FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia/FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia.csproj`: opts into `net9.0;net9.0-android` when `EnableAndroidTarget=true` (default OFF, so the desktop `.sln`/CI see `net9.0` only). On the android TFM `OutputType=Library`, `app.manifest` / `Avalonia.Desktop` / `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp` / `Program.cs` / the `GapSweep` dev-tooling are all excluded. The Android head's `ProjectReference` activates the android TFM via `AdditionalProperties="EnableAndroidTarget=true"`. This resolves the prerequisite #1121. |
| `FEBuilderGBA` (WinForms) | `net9.0-windows` | **No — must be excluded** | WinForms + P/Invoke + `System.Drawing`. Never reference it from an Android head. |

**The Android head must reference only `FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia`** (which transitively
pulls in `Core` + `SkiaSharp`). The WinForms project is explicitly out of scope.

## 2. Avalonia-on-Android specifics (lifetime & windowing)

Avalonia 11 ships a real Android target: the `Avalonia.Android` package, an
`[Activity]`-attributed `MainActivity : AvaloniaMainActivity<App>` entry point,
and a **single-view** application lifetime (`ISingleViewApplicationLifetime`) —
one Activity hosting one root view.

The current desktop app is built around the **classic desktop** lifetime and a
**multi-window** model, which is the single biggest port item:

- **Entry point / lifetime.** `FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia/Program.cs:33`
  `BuildAvaloniaApp().StartWithClassicDesktopLifetime(args)` with `[STAThread]`.
  `App.OnFrameworkInitializationCompleted` (`App.axaml.cs:188-203`) only builds
  its UI inside `if (ApplicationLifetime is IClassicDesktopStyleApplicationLifetime desktop)`
  and sets `desktop.MainWindow = new Views.MainWindow()`. **Under the single-view
  Android lifetime, that branch is never entered** — so the skeleton boots the
  Avalonia runtime but presents no editor. Android needs an
  `else if (ApplicationLifetime is ISingleViewApplicationLifetime singleView)`
  branch that sets `singleView.MainView`.
- **Multi-window → single-view.** `FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia/Services/WindowManager.cs`
  is built on top-level `Window`s: `Open<T>` calls `window.Show()` (line 32),
  `OpenModal<T>` / `PickFromEditor<T>` call `window.ShowDialog(parent)` (lines
  50 / 94), and it caches a `Dictionary<Type, Window>` (line 17). Roughly
  356 of 358 views are top-level `Window` / `TranslatedWindow`. Android has **no
  desktop multi-window model**, so the navigation layer must be reworked to a
  page/view-stack (e.g. a single host view with a back stack, or Avalonia
  navigation controls). This is the **largest** follow-up
  ([single-activity navigation model](#8-follow-up-sub-issues)).

The repository's `FEBuilderGBA.Android/MainActivity.cs` is the Android-equivalent
of `Program.Main` — it subclasses `AvaloniaMainActivity<App>` and reuses the
shared `App`. Its XML doc records the single-view limitation above honestly.

---

## 3. SkiaSharp native-version constraint (CRITICAL)

This is a known landmine in this repo. **A process loads exactly one native
`libSkiaSharp`, so the managed SkiaSharp version must match the native that
Avalonia bundles.** Avalonia 11.2.3 bundles native Skia `2.88.x`; managed
SkiaSharp `3.x` rejects the `2.88` native ("88.1") and crashes inside the
Avalonia process with a `TypeInitializationException` on non-Windows
(Windows can mask it). See `FEBuilderGBA.SkiaSharp/FEBuilderGBA.SkiaSharp.csproj:7-13`
(pinned to `SkiaSharp 2.88.9`) and issues #796 / #798.

**For Android:** add `SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Android` **pinned to the same
`2.88.9` family** — never float it to `3.x` independently. The skeleton's
`FEBuilderGBA.Android.csproj` already pins it:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Android" Version="2.88.9" />
```

**Risk:** font/image byte-parity is currently golden-tested only on the desktop
native. The Android native (`2.88.9` for the four Android ABIs) must be re-verified
for byte-identical rendering output — a parity smoke test is a tracked follow-up.

---

## 4. ROM file access on Android (scoped storage / SAF)

Desktop ROM I/O is path-based and will not work under Android scoped storage:

- `FEBuilderGBA.Core/Rom.cs:606` / `Rom.cs:619` `File.ReadAllBytes(name)`;
  `Rom.cs:654` `Save(string name, bool silent)` writes by path.
- `FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia/Dialogs/FileDialogHelper.cs:52,65` collapse every
  picker result to `IStorageFile.TryGetLocalPath()`. On Android, SAF returns
  **`content://` URIs** that frequently have **no stable local path**, so
  `TryGetLocalPath()` returns `null` and a perfectly valid pick reads as
  "cancelled".

**What Avalonia's `IStorageProvider` gives you on Android:** the same
`OpenFilePickerAsync` / `SaveFilePickerAsync` API the desktop helper already uses
(`FileDialogHelper.cs:45,58`), but the returned `IStorageFile` must be consumed
via **streams** (`OpenReadAsync` / `OpenWriteAsync`), keeping the storage handle
/ URI rather than reducing it to a path.

**Required port:** add **stream-based** ROM load/save to `Rom` (alongside the
path-based overloads) and return/retain the `IStorageFile` instead of a path.
Also redirect the desktop side-writes — `Log` (`FEBuilderGBA.Core/Log.cs:53`),
`Config.Save`, and `AutoSaveService` (`FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia/Services/AutoSaveService.cs:33-114`),
which write beside the exe / ROM — to **app-private storage** (`Context.FilesDir`).

---

## 5. `config/` packaging for an APK

> **Status: implemented (#1123) — build-only validated, not yet device-validated.**

The `config/` directory (game data, scripts, names, translations) is **required
at runtime**: `FEBuilderGBA.Core/PathUtil.cs:39` resolves `config/<subpath>`
relative to `CoreState.BaseDirectory`, which `App.axaml.cs` sets to
`AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory` on desktop. On desktop,
`FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia.csproj` copies `config/**` (excluding `patch2`) as loose
files beside the exe.

**Inside an APK there is no "beside the exe" loose-file layout.** The Android
head therefore ships + extracts config:

1. `config/**` (excluding `patch2`) ships as **`AndroidAsset`**
   (`FEBuilderGBA.Android.csproj`:
   `<AndroidAsset Include="..\config\**\*" Exclude="..\config\patch2\**" Link="config\..." />`).
   The glob is `**\*` (not `*.*`) so a future extensionless config file is not
   silently dropped, and the `Link` lands every asset under a clean
   `assets/config/...` tree inside the APK.
2. On first run, the assets are **extracted once** into app-private storage
   (`Context.FilesDir`), **version-stamped** so an app-version bump re-extracts.
   The extraction logic lives in the **pure, desktop-unit-testable**
   `FEBuilderGBA.Core/AndroidConfigExtractorCore.cs` (an `IAssetSource` seam +
   `EnsureExtracted`), with the Android `AssetManager` only as a source adapter
   (`FEBuilderGBA.Android/AndroidAssetSource.cs`). The version stamp doubles as a
   completeness manifest, so the guarantee is: skip when up-to-date; re-extract
   on version bump; **crash-before-stamp recovery** (the stamp is written LAST);
   and **manifest-completeness re-extract** (a matching stamp with any missing
   extracted file forces a clean re-extract). Path-traversal is rejected
   defensively: rooted / `..` entries from the asset source are dropped, a
   tampered/corrupt stamp listing rooted / `..` entries is treated as invalid
   (re-extract, never a false "up to date"), and the `stampFileName` public-API
   argument is validated to be a plain file name.
3. `FEBuilderGBA.Android/MainActivity.OnCreate` runs the extraction **before**
   the Avalonia app boots and points the android-only
   `App.BaseDirectoryOverride` at the extracted root, so the shared
   `App.OnFrameworkInitializationCompleted` sets `CoreState.BaseDirectory` there.
   On desktop the override is always null, so **desktop base-directory resolution
   is unchanged**. Extraction failure logs + rethrows (fail fast — a booted app
   with missing config is worse than a visible crash).

> **patch2 delivery decision: `config/patch2` is NOT bundled for Android
> (deferred).** It is a runtime-installed git submodule (hundreds of MB) that the
> desktop app installs on demand via `GitUtil`; bundling it would bloat the APK
> enormously and Android has no in-process git. Deciding on-device patch delivery
> (e.g. an on-demand download into `FilesDir`) is tracked under the epic #1070,
> not this issue. The issue explicitly accepts "deferred / not bundled."

> **Validation note (#1123).** No device/emulator was available, so this was
> **desktop/build-only validated**: the extraction logic is unit-tested on desktop
> (`FEBuilderGBA.Core.Tests/AndroidConfigExtractorCoreTests.cs` — fresh extract,
> version-stamp skip, version-bump re-extract, partial/corrupt re-extract,
> crash-before-stamp recovery, manifest-completeness, nested paths,
> path-traversal rejection, unrelated-dir isolation) and the APK is verified to
> contain `assets/config/...` while excluding `assets/config/patch2/` (unzip +
> grep). On-device first-run extraction runtime is tracked under #1070.

---

## 6. `Process.Start` / external tools

Roughly 40 `Process.Start` call sites across ~17 files assume a desktop OS:

- **Open-file / open-folder / open-URL** (`UseShellExecute`, `explorer.exe /select`)
  → on Android these become an `Intent ACTION_VIEW`, or are simply disabled.
- **Real subprocess launches** — the devkitARM assembler (`arm-none-eabi-as`
  + `objcopy`) in the ASM editor, and the GBA emulator test-play launcher — are
  **desktop-only** and must be disabled on Android (Android apps can't fork
  arbitrary native subprocesses).
- **Feature-parity note:** event-script compilation (EA/ColorzCore) is **not**
  wired into the Avalonia GUI yet (only the CLI `--compile-event` and the
  WinForms `EventAssemblerForm`). If it is ever brought to Avalonia, note that
  it spawns external EA/ColorzCore **processes**, which Android cannot do — it
  would need **in-process** ColorzCore (it is a .NET library) or stay
  desktop-only.

---

## 7. Build status in this environment

This section is deliberately precise about **what built vs what is authored-only**.

### Prerequisites (general)

- The **`net9.0-android` TFM** + the **`android` .NET workload**
  (`dotnet workload install android`).
- The **Android SDK** (platform + build-tools) with **accepted licenses**, and a
  suitable **JDK**. Microsoft's current .NET-for-Android guidance recommends
  **Microsoft OpenJDK (17+/21)**; a modern JDK is required. (Do not assume an
  old JDK works — verify against the actual build.)

### What this environment had

- `dotnet workload list` → **`android 35.0.78/9.0.100` is INSTALLED.**
- Android SDK present at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk`
  (platforms `android-34` + `android-35`, build-tools `35.0.0`).
- JDK present: Microsoft OpenJDK 11.

### What actually built here

- ✅ **A minimal standalone `net9.0-android` project builds end-to-end** —
  `dotnet build` produced a managed `.dll` **and** packaged + signed `.apk`
  files (`*-Signed.apk`). This proves the workload + SDK + JDK toolchain is
  fully functional in this environment.
- ✅ **The Android head's own code compiles against `FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia`** —
  with the required `-p:EnableAndroidTarget=true` global flag (see the next
  bullet), `dotnet build` restores + compiles `MainActivity` (which references
  the shared `App` + views) and packages the APK. (A *bare*
  `dotnet build FEBuilderGBA.Android.csproj` — without the global property —
  fails restore with `NETSDK1005`, because NuGet restore's static graph ignores
  the per-reference `AdditionalProperties`; the next bullet explains this.)
- ✅ **The full FEBuilderGBA Android APK NOW builds (#1121).** The structural
  blocker below is resolved: `FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia` conditionally multi-targets
  `net9.0;net9.0-android` (opt-in via `EnableAndroidTarget`), and the Android
  head's `ProjectReference` carries `AdditionalProperties="EnableAndroidTarget=true"`.
  Build it with the property as a **global** flag:
  ```bash
  dotnet build FEBuilderGBA.Android/FEBuilderGBA.Android.csproj -c Release -p:EnableAndroidTarget=true
  ```
  This produced both `com.laqieer.febuildergba.apk` and the signed
  `com.laqieer.febuildergba-Signed.apk` (~33 MB each) under
  `bin/Release/net9.0-android/`, with `FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia.dll` compiled under
  the android TFM. **Why the global `-p:` is required:** the `AdditionalProperties`
  on the ProjectReference correctly drives the *build* phase, but NuGet *restore*
  uses a separate static graph that does **not** apply per-reference
  `AdditionalProperties` when resolving a referenced project's target frameworks
  — verified via an MSBuild probe (`-getProperty:TargetFrameworks` returns
  `net9.0;net9.0-android` only when `EnableAndroidTarget=true` is set). Without
  the global property, restore writes a net9.0-only `project.assets.json` for the
  shared project and the build fails with `NETSDK1005`. On the android TFM the
  shared project excludes `Program.cs`, `Avalonia.Desktop`, `app.manifest`, the
  `GapSweep` Roslyn dev-tooling (`GapSweep/**` + `App.GapSweep.cs`) and the
  `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp` package; the `GapSweep` dispatch in
  `App.OnFrameworkInitializationCompleted` is `#if !ANDROID`-guarded. The only
  android-specific warnings are benign `XA0141` 16-KB-page-size advisories on the
  prebuilt Skia/HarfBuzz `.so` natives.

### Historical blocker (resolved by #1121)

Before #1121, once the build moved to per-RID packaging
(`android-x64` / `android-arm64`) it failed with `NETSDK1047` (and, with an
explicit RID, `NETSDK1112`) because the referenced **`FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia`
project targeted plain `net9.0`** and therefore had no `net9.0-android` /
android-bionic runtime-pack target for the RID resolver to consume. The
conditional multi-target gives the resolver a real `net9.0-android` target.

### Honest conclusion

The Android APK builds against the shared Avalonia UI (#1121). What remains is
**runtime**, not structural — the APK is **not yet device/emulator-validated**:

- Under the single-view Android lifetime, `App.OnFrameworkInitializationCompleted`
  still only presents UI in its `IClassicDesktopStyleApplicationLifetime` branch,
  so the booted app does not yet show the editor — the
  `ISingleViewApplicationLifetime.MainView` + `WindowManager` page/view-stack
  rework is #1122 (see §2).
- `config/**` ships as an extracted `AndroidAsset` with version-stamped first-run
  extraction to `Context.FilesDir` (#1123, build-only validated — see §5). ROM
  open/save (the remaining storage item) is still path-based.
- ROM open/save still goes through path-based I/O; SAF stream I/O is #1124 (see §4).

> The Android head needs `FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia` to be android-aware, which it
> now is *opt-in*; the `EnableAndroidTarget` default is OFF so the desktop build
> is unchanged. The `FEBuilderGBA.Android/` project remains **deliberately

> ```

## 8. Follow-up sub-issues

The real port work surfaced by this exploration is split into concrete issues,
linked under #1070 as its checklist:

1. ~~**Android: multi-target `FEBuilderGBA.Avalonia` (or split a shared UI library)
   so the Android head can be packaged into an APK.**~~ **DONE (#1121)** — the
   shared project conditionally multi-targets `net9.0;net9.0-android`; the head
   builds a real APK (build-only — not yet device-validated). *(prerequisite —
   unblocked everything below; see §7.)*
2. **Android: single-activity navigation model for the multi-window editors**
   (`WindowManager` page/view-stack rework + `ISingleViewApplicationLifetime`
   `MainView`). *(largest item; see §2.)*
3. ~~**Android: bundle `config/` as `AndroidAsset` + extract to `FilesDir` at
   first run** (version-stamped); decide `patch2` delivery.~~ **DONE (#1123)** —
   build-only validated (no device); `config/patch2` deferred / not bundled.
   *(see §5.)*
4. **Android: ROM open/save via `IStorageProvider`/SAF streams** (+ redirect
   `Log` / `Config.Save` / `AutoSaveService` to app-private storage). *(see §4.)*
5. **Android: `SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Android` version pinning + render
   byte-parity smoke test** on the Android native. *(see §3.)*
6. **Android: CI job + signed APK packaging** (separate android-workload job,
   not the desktop `.sln` build). *(see §7.)*

---

## 9. Recommendation & phased path

Treat native Android as a **separate port after the desktop Avalonia version
stabilizes** (it is still reaching WinForms parity). The Skia / Core foundation
is ready; the **windowing model, storage, and touch UX are the real work.** Do
not promise Android from "Avalonia supports Android" alone.

**Phased path:**

1. ~~**Phase A — make it packageable.**~~ **DONE (#1121)** — the shared UI is
   conditionally multi-targeted and the Android head builds an APK.
2. **Phase B — make it run.** Single-view lifetime + a minimal navigation host
   (#2), config extraction (#3 — **DONE (#1123)**, build-only), and SAF ROM I/O
   (#4) — enough to open a ROM and show one editor on a device.
3. **Phase C — make it usable.** Touch UX adaptation (larger hit targets,
   phone/tablet layouts, touch-friendly numeric entry replacing the ~2,300
   `NumericUpDown` spinner usages and the desktop menu bar), then the Skia parity smoke
   test (#5) and a CI/APK job (#6).

Phase A landed in #1121: the `FEBuilderGBA.Android/` head now builds a real APK
against the shared, conditionally-multi-targeted Avalonia UI. It is **not yet a
runnable app** — booting it presents no editor under the single-view lifetime
until the navigation rework (Phase B / #1122) lands.
